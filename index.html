           Love is different










‘To His Coy Mistress’ and ‘Sonnet 116’ are two poems written on the theme of love and both poems are addressed to an unknown recipient. Both poems are noticeably different, despite having the same theme. The first difference is the type of love portrayed in the two poems, ‘To His Coy Mistress’ the love that is portrayed is sexual love, love with desire. ‘Sonnet 116,’ portrays and addresses what love is. The structure of the two poems is also different Marvell attempts syllogism by dividing his poem into a three-part argument while Shakespeare follows the authentic Sonnet structure giving his poem a rhyme scheme abab cdcd efef gg.
             ‘To His Coy Mistress,’  Stanza one talks about, if they had forever then they would take their time and not rush we can see this in this line  “An hundred years should go to praise…”  The second stanza of the poem is written in a depressing tone, it also brings out a form of shock as it reminds the recipient, and the speaker about death “The grave's a fine and private place, But none, I think, do there embrace.” This event shows that they must die one day and it might be too late. The last stanza is in an encouraging tone and urgency whereby the speaker wants her to listen to him and to agree to what he is saying “And while thy willing soul transpires At every pore with instant fires,”  This line shows the eagerness, the hurry and the encouragement for having sex.
                 Shakespeare’s Sonnet 116 is a closed form poem as it is written to a set of rules. It attempts to define by telling both what love is and what love is not. In the first quatrain, the speaker says that “ the marriage of true minds” - shows perfect unchanging love. It also that love does not change when it sees flaws in the loved ones this is shown in the line that says “admit impediments” The second quatrain the speaker shows us how love is and tells us that love provides guidance by using a metaphor “ It is a star to every wandering bark,”  In the last quatrain the speaker describes what love is not he says “Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks,” this shows that love is not bound by time but beauty and at last he shows confidence by saying “If this be error, and upon me prov’d, I never writ, nor no man ever lov’d.” This shows us how confident he is about love.
              The poems relate to the theme of love. However, both views are extremely different. Andrew Marvell is more focused on the physical side of love. In ‘To His Coy Mistress,’ time is seen as a destroyer that cannot be stopped no matter how much two people love each other. However, in the sonnet 116 time is something that does not affect true love. Shakespeare believes true love is constant even when it is tested with life troubles and problems it will extend beyond existence.
             A connection between the two poems is that both poems use distinct tones to get the message across. In part of Andrew Marvell’s ‘To His Coy Mistress,’  the tone is of acceptance, relaxation and patience. Stanza two the poet becomes more depressed and persuasive. In the last stanza, the tone is more encouraging and urgent. There is a distinct change in Andrew Marvell’s poem, Shakespeare’s tone is consistent throughout the whole poem his tone is more independent and guiding. It is also shown that Shakespeare believes strongly in this issue as he does not change his mind about love and keeps a confident and positive tone throughout.
            Both poems use vivid, clear and effective imagery. Just as the tone Marvell also makes other changes to bring out an impact. Andrew Marvell brings out the imagery in a way that we can understand the different tones. In stanza one where the tone is of relaxation, he talks about “My vegetable love should grow Vaster than empires, and more slow”; it brings out imagery whereby we imagine the slow growth of vegetables and empires. In stanza two there is a change in tone as it becomes more intense as he talks about death and the line “My echoing song: then worms shall try That long preserved virginity,” brings visual imagery of worms. In the last stanza, he shows desperation and hurry using personification whereby he personifies the sun by saying “Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run.” 
            Sonnet 116 takes on a more positive attitude to love and time. “Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks” here the speaker personifies time and calls it a fool. Shakespeare means that love is unbeatable and makes fun of time. The second part means that physical beauty will fade but love will not that is why he exclaims in the next line “O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandering bark,” this brings visual imagery we imagine a mark that stays with us forever. The second part says that love is like a guiding light that guides you. Shakespeare is saying love is something that you can always rely on for guidance. He has brought about this expression through metaphor. The speaker ends with confidence, the speaker ends on a very strong note.
            Time is addressed in both poems. “Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.” Shakespeare’s Sonnet contrasts with Andrew Marvell’s  ‘To His Coy Mistress,’ as Marvell is worried that they will die and time will destroy them, Shakespeare believes love will not die even if the lovers die. This shows us how different the poem is despite the same theme.
             Marvell and Shakespeare proceed to use the same theme or subject matter and express their view using effective imagery that is linked to the subject matter. But there are significant differences in how the poem is written and presented that helps us understand that the treatment of the subject love is different we can see this from the tone to the structures.
